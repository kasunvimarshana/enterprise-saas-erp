\# ERP-Grade Modular SaaS Platform



\## Overview



This repository contains a fully production-ready, ERP-grade, modular SaaS platform engineered for long-term scalability, security, and maintainability. The system is designed and implemented using \*\*Laravel\*\* for the backend and \*\*Vue.js with Vite\*\* for the frontend, optionally leveraging \*\*Tailwind CSS\*\* and \*\*AdminLTE\*\* for UI composition. The architecture strictly follows \*\*Clean Architecture\*\*, \*\*Modular Architecture\*\*, and the \*\*Controller → Service → Repository\*\* pattern, while rigorously enforcing \*\*SOLID\*\*, \*\*DRY\*\*, and \*\*KISS\*\* principles to ensure strong separation of concerns, loose coupling, high testability, optimal performance, minimal technical debt, and long-term sustainability.



\## Architectural Principles



\* Clean Architecture with clear boundary enforcement

\* Feature-based Modular Architecture (backend and frontend)

\* Controller → Service → Repository orchestration

\* Service-layer-only cross-module coordination

\* Explicit transactional boundaries with rollback safety

\* Event-driven architecture for asynchronous workflows only

\* Tenant-aware design enforced at every layer



\## Multi-Tenancy \& Security Model



The platform implements a \*\*strictly isolated multi-tenant architecture\*\* supporting:



\* Multi-organization, multi-vendor, multi-branch, and multi-location operations

\* Multi-currency, multi-language (i18n), and multi-unit support

\* Fine-grained \*\*RBAC/ABAC\*\* enforced through authentication, policies, guards, and global scopes

\* Tenant-aware authentication and authorization across all layers



Enterprise-grade SaaS security standards are applied throughout the system, including HTTPS enforcement, encryption at rest, secure credential storage, strict request validation, rate limiting, structured logging, and immutable audit trails.



\## Core \& ERP Modules



The platform fully designs, implements, and integrates all required \*\*core\*\*, \*\*ERP\*\*, and \*\*cross-cutting\*\* modules without omission, including but not limited to:



\* Identity \& Access Management (IAM)

\* Tenants, subscriptions, and billing

\* Organizations, users, roles, and permissions

\* Master data and system configurations

\* CRM and centralized cross-branch histories

\* Inventory and procurement using \*\*append-only stock ledgers\*\*

\* SKU and variant modeling

\* Batch, lot, serial, and expiry tracking with FIFO/FEFO handling

\* Pricing with multiple price lists and pricing rules

\* POS, invoicing, payments, and taxation

\* eCommerce and telematics integrations

\* Manufacturing and warehouse operations

\* Reporting, analytics, and KPI dashboards

\* Notifications, integrations, logging, and auditing

\* System administration and operational tooling



\## Inventory \& Ledger Design



Inventory management is implemented using an \*\*append-only stock ledger\*\* model:



\* Stock balances are never mutated directly

\* All movements are recorded as immutable ledger entries

\* Supports FIFO and FEFO strategies

\* Batch, lot, serial, and expiry-aware validation

\* Fully transactional with rollback safety and auditability



\## Service-Oriented Orchestration



All business logic and cross-module interactions are orchestrated exclusively at the \*\*service layer\*\*, guaranteeing:



\* Atomic transactions

\* Idempotent operations

\* Consistent exception propagation

\* Global rollback safety



Asynchronous workflows are implemented strictly through event-driven mechanisms using events, listeners, and background jobs, without compromising transactional consistency.



\## API Design



\* Clean, versioned REST APIs

\* Tenant-aware request handling

\* Bulk operations via CSV and API endpoints

\* Swagger / OpenAPI documentation included

\* Strict validation and rate limiting applied globally



\## Frontend Architecture



The Vue.js frontend follows a \*\*feature-based modular architecture\*\*:



\* Vite-powered build system

\* Centralized state management

\* Permission-aware UI composition

\* Route-level and component-level access control

\* Localization (i18n) support

\* Reusable component library

\* Responsive, accessible layouts with professional theming



\## Deliverables



The repository provides a fully scaffolded, ready-to-run, LTS-ready solution, including:



\* Database migrations and seeders

\* Eloquent models and repositories

\* DTOs and service classes

\* Controllers, middleware, and policies

\* Events, listeners, and background jobs

\* Notifications and integration hooks

\* Structured logging and immutable audit trails

\* Swagger / OpenAPI specifications

\* Modular Vue frontend with routing, state management, and localization



\## Technology Constraints



\* Relies only on native Laravel and Vue framework features or stable LTS-grade libraries

\* Avoids experimental or short-lived dependencies

\* Designed for long-term support and enterprise evolution



\## Vision



This platform is engineered to serve as a \*\*secure, extensible, configurable, and enterprise-ready SaaS ERP foundation\*\*, capable of evolving into a complete, multi-industry ERP ecosystem while maintaining architectural integrity, performance, and operational excellence.
