# ERP-Grade Modular SaaS Platform

## Purpose & Scope
This repository defines and delivers a **fully production-ready, ERP-grade, modular SaaS platform** architected for long-term scalability, security, and maintainability. It serves as both an **implementation blueprint** and an **architectural contract** for humans and AI-assisted tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot), ensuring consistent, enterprise-grade outcomes.

The system is designed, reviewed, reconciled, and implemented using **Laravel** (backend) and **Vue.js with Vite** (frontend), optionally leveraging **Tailwind CSS** and **AdminLTE**, while strictly enforcing **Clean Architecture**, **Modular Architecture**, and the **Controller → Service → Repository** pattern. All design and implementation decisions adhere to **SOLID**, **DRY**, and **KISS** principles to guarantee strong separation of concerns, loose coupling, scalability, performance, high testability, minimal technical debt, and long-term maintainability.

## Architectural Principles
- Clean Architecture with explicit boundary enforcement
- Feature-based Modular Architecture (backend and frontend)
- Controller → Service → Repository (CSR) pattern
- Service-layer-only orchestration for business logic
- Explicit transactional boundaries with rollback safety
- Event-driven architecture strictly for asynchronous workflows
- Tenant-aware design enforced consistently across all layers

## Multi-Tenancy & Access Control
The platform implements a **strictly isolated, tenant-aware multi-tenant foundation** supporting:
- Multi-organization, multi-vendor, multi-branch, and multi-location operations
- Multi-currency, multi-language (i18n), and multi-unit support
- Fine-grained **RBAC/ABAC** enforced through authentication, policies, guards, and global scopes
- Tenant-aware authentication, authorization, and data isolation at every layer

## Security Standards
Enterprise-grade SaaS security is applied end-to-end:
- HTTPS enforcement
- Encryption at rest
- Secure credential storage
- Strict request and domain validation
- Rate limiting and abuse protection
- Structured logging
- Immutable audit trails

## Core, ERP & Cross-Cutting Modules
All required modules are fully designed and integrated without omission, including:

- Identity & Access Management (IAM)
- Tenants, subscriptions, and billing
- Organizations, users, roles, and permissions
- Master data and system configurations
- CRM and centralized cross-branch histories
- Inventory and procurement using **append-only stock ledgers**
- SKU and variant modeling
- Batch, lot, serial, and expiry tracking with FIFO/FEFO
- Pricing with multiple price lists and pricing rules
- POS, invoicing, payments, and taxation
- eCommerce and telematics
- Manufacturing and warehouse operations
- Reporting, analytics, and KPI dashboards
- Notifications, integrations, logging, and auditing
- System administration and operational tooling

## Inventory & Ledger Model
Inventory management follows a **ledger-first, append-only design**:
- Stock balances are never mutated directly
- All movements are recorded as immutable ledger entries
- FIFO and FEFO strategies are enforced at the service layer
- Batch, lot, serial, and expiry constraints are validated transactionally
- Full auditability and rollback safety are guaranteed

## Service-Layer Orchestration
All cross-module interactions and business workflows are orchestrated **exclusively within the service layer**, ensuring:
- Atomic transactions
- Idempotent operations
- Consistent exception propagation
- Global rollback safety

Asynchronous workflows are implemented strictly via **event-driven mechanisms** (events, listeners, background jobs) without violating transactional integrity.

## API Design
- Clean, versioned REST APIs
- Tenant-aware request handling
- Bulk operations via CSV and APIs
- Global validation and rate limiting
- Swagger / OpenAPI documentation provided

## Frontend Architecture
The Vue.js frontend follows a **feature-based modular architecture**:
- Vite-powered build system
- Centralized state management
- Permission-aware UI composition
- Route- and component-level access control
- Localization (i18n) support
- Reusable, composable UI components
- Responsive, accessible layouts with professional theming

## Deliverables
The repository delivers a **fully scaffolded, ready-to-run, LTS-ready solution**, including:
- Database migrations and seeders
- Domain models and repositories
- DTOs and service classes
- Controllers, middleware, and policies
- Events, listeners, and background jobs
- Notifications and integration hooks
- Structured logging and immutable audit trails
- Swagger / OpenAPI specifications
- Modular Vue frontend with routing, state management, and localization

## Dependency & LTS Policy
- Uses only native Laravel and Vue features or stable LTS-grade libraries
- Avoids experimental or short-lived dependencies
- Designed for long-term support and enterprise evolution

## AI Tooling Alignment (GitHub Copilot)
This README acts as the **authoritative architectural reference** for GitHub Copilot and similar AI tools. A complementary `copilot-instructions.md` file must be used to provide compressed, task-oriented guidance, while this document remains the single source of truth for architecture, constraints, and system guarantees.

## Vision
This platform is engineered as a **secure, extensible, configurable, and enterprise-ready SaaS ERP foundation**, capable of evolving into a complete, multi-industry ERP ecosystem while preserving architectural integrity, performance, and operational excellence.
